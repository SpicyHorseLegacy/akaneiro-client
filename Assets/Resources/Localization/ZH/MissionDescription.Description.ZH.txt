To desecrate the souls of such noble creatures is a most foul act...	4
122							Stirring Spirits	The Ghostclaw Cult is responsible for raising wolves from death. Explore the cave system - Daisuke can open the way. Search for information on Ghostclaw activity there.	The truth behind the Ghostclaw Cult is disturbing indeed. We must put them to the sword.

142							Don't Dawdle	The temple cellar is a maze of twisted passages  and dead-ends. Beware; a terrible beast stalks the adjoining caves. Secure the Temple stairway, then report back.	Excellent - you have returned safely. Now I can join you in an assault on Chief Bloodfang!

152							Creeping Cold	Local fishermen have reported seeing ice men by the frozen bank of the river. It seems they’re gathering to move upon local shrines which protect Yomi village. Save the shrines at all costs.	The Shrines remain to protect Yomi from being swallowed by Winter. Fine work!

183							What Lies Below	There is a large Magjaw tunnel system adjoining a deeper region of the Temple Catacombs. If we close it off, it'll block any further invaders. 	The Magjaw have been repelled, but not defeated. Perhaps we ought to take the fight to them, next time.
